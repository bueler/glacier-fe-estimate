# glacier-fe-estimate

This is a project to prove estimates for finite element (FE) methods applied to the evolution of glaciers under Stokes dynamics.  Well-posedness of the continuum problem, for an implicit time-step, is only conjectural at this time.  The main idea is to extend the Falk (1974) technique for estimating FE errors in variational inequalities.
